## How it works

- Get image from camera
- Convert to gray scale
- Blur the image reduce noise (details of the image are unimportant)
- Use threshold (low pass filter) to get black and white image
- Analyze the received shape to find convex hull/convexity defects
- If in debug mode display visuals
- Send some info to Tk control window

### Requirements

+ Run requirements.txt

	`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- python (tested on 2.7.12, should work on other versions)
- OpenCV-Python >= 3.0 (more here: http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html, sometimes named as python-opencv package in system repositories)
- Tkinter (ussually comes with Python or as a addtional package)
- numpy
- vlc-ctrl (https://github.com/amol9/vlc-ctrl)

Pip-installable list:
```
numpy
vlc-ctrl
```
